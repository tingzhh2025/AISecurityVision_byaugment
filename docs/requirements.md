# C++17 AI Security Visual Analysis System Requirements

## 1. Project Description

### 1.1 Overview
Real-time AI security system processing RTSP/ONVIF/GB28181 video streams with the following capabilities:
- Object detection (YOLOv8 optimized with TensorRT)
- Face and license plate recognition
- Behavior analysis (absenteeism, intrusion, crowd gathering, loitering, falls, fights)
- Event recording and alarm推送
- FFmpeg-based stream processing
- SQLite3 data storage

### 1.2 Application Type
Web application with RESTful API interface and real-time video streaming capabilities.

### 1.3 Architecture
Multi-threaded pipeline architecture with the following components:
- Video input layer (RTSP/ONVIF/GB28181)
- AI processing pipeline (parallel instances per stream)
- Output modules (recording, streaming, alarms)
- Management API (HTTP server)
- Data persistence layer (SQLite3)

## 2. Functional Specifications

### 2.1 User Interface
- Web-based management console
- Real-time video monitoring view
- Event log dashboard
- Configuration interface for AI rules

### 2.2 Business Logic
