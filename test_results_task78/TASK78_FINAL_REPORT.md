## Conclusion
Task 78 implementation provides comprehensive multi-camera test sequence validation with:
- ✅ Ground truth generation for known object transitions
- ✅ Real-time system monitoring during test execution
- ✅ Automated validation of ReID tracking consistency
- ✅ Detailed reporting and logging infrastructure
- ✅ 90% consistency threshold validation

The test framework successfully validates cross-camera object tracking and ReID persistence as required by Task 78.
